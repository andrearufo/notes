# What is this 'notes'

It's a super simply and flat CMS that provide you to create a list of posts, or articles, or notes just whit the upload of some Markdown files to a web folder.

## And why?

Cause we are devs! And we don't need a complex database system with control pannel to write 5 rows of shit and diffuse the knowledge on the web.

## How are you?
